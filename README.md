* Yuck Donald's - Yuck Donald's is considering opening a series of restaurants along Quaint Valley Highway (QVH). The n possible locations are along a straight line, and the distances of these locations from the start of QVH are, in miles and in increasing order, m1, m2, ...mn. The constraints are as follows:
* At wach location, Yuckdonald's may open atmost one restaurant. The expected profit from opening a shop at location i is pi, where pi>0 and i=1,2,...n.
* Any two restaurants must be atleast k miles apart, where k is a positive integer.
Give an efficient algorithm to compute the maximum expected total profit subject to the given constraints
